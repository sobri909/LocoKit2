## Task Start Instructions

You must read all of these documents (they are already in context, but you can read_file them again if you want them front and centre):
- workflow.md
- filesystem.md
- locokit2_manifest.md
- arc_manifest.md

Do not respond without having read these files and then followed the relevant instructions within them in terms of the current task being discussed.

If the task requires knowledge of the contents of various source files, read those files in before responding. If you respond without having read in sufficient context to fully understand the task at hand the user will direct you back to these instructions to repeat until you have done so.

Before EVERY response in the chat you must assess whether there are any relevant source files that are not yet loaded into the context, and read_file them in before formulating your thoughts and response. 

Once you have done that necessary work described above, and ONLY once you have done the necessary work, share your initial thoughts and questions on the task at hand. Thanks!
