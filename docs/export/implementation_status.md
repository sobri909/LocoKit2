# Implementation Status

Current status of the export/import system implementation.

## Complete

### Core Infrastructure
- [x] PersistenceActor and ExportManager with proper isolation
- [x] Export directory structure with basic organization
- [x] Error handling and state management
- [x] JSON encoding with formatting and sorting

### Export Format 
- [x] Basic file organization (places, items, samples)
- [x] UUID-based place bucketing (00.json through FF.json)
- [x] Month-based item files (YYYY-MM.json)
- [x] Week-based sample files (YYYY-Www.json)
- [x] Proper date sorting before grouping
- [x] Standardized uppercase UUIDs

## In Progress

### Error Handling
- [ ] Export cancellation handling
- [ ] Cleanup of partial exports on failure
- [ ] Recovery from interrupted exports

### Progress Tracking
- [ ] Phase-specific progress reporting
- [ ] Overall progress calculation
- [ ] UI integration for progress display

### Performance
- [ ] Batching for large datasets
- [ ] Memory management during export
- [ ] Progress vs performance tradeoffs

### Compression Support
- [ ] Optional gzip compression (.json.gz)
