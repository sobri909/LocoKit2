# Implementation Status

Current status of the export/import system implementation.

## Complete

### Core Infrastructure
- [x] PersistenceActor and ExportManager with proper isolation
- [x] Export directory structure with basic organization
- [x] Error handling and state management
- [x] JSON encoding with formatting and sorting

### Export Format 
- [x] Basic file organization (places, items, samples)
- [x] UUID-based place bucketing (00.json through FF.json)
- [x] Month-based item files (YYYY-MM.json)
- [x] Week-based sample files (YYYY-Www.json)
- [x] Proper date sorting before grouping
- [x] Standardized uppercase UUIDs

## In Progress

### Error Handling
- [ ] Export cancellation handling
- [ ] Cleanup of partial exports on failure
- [ ] Recovery from interrupted exports

### Progress Tracking
- [ ] Phase-specific progress reporting
- [ ] Overall progress calculation
- [ ] UI integration for progress display

### Performance
- [x] Batched processing for items and edges
- [x] Memory-efficient JSONL edge record handling
- [ ] Memory management optimizations for large exports
- [ ] Performance vs progress tracking tradeoffs

### Compression Support
- [ ] Optional gzip compression (.json.gz)
- [ ] Flexible format handling on import
- [ ] Performance testing of compressed vs uncompressed
- [ ] Infrastructure for future compression formats

### Import System
- [x] Import validation
- [x] Two-phase import implementation
- [x] Edge relationship restoration
- [x] Basic error handling
- [x] Basic place/item/sample import logic
- [ ] Progress tracking
- [ ] Sample FK constraint handling
- [ ] LastSaved checks for incremental imports

## Future Work

### Arc Editor Features
- [ ] Automatic daily/monthly export updates
- [ ] UI for manual exports (date range selection)
- [ ] Export browser/viewer
- [ ] Import progress display

### Legacy Support
- [ ] Conversion tools for old Arc Timeline exports
- [ ] Format version detection and handling

### Documentation
- [x] Export format specification with versioning
- [x] Import process documentation
- [x] Design decisions and rationale
- [ ] API documentation for third parties

### Recording Management
- [x] Basic import/recording state coordination via PersistenceActor
- [ ] Sample buffering during imports
- [ ] Enhanced timeline processing coordination
