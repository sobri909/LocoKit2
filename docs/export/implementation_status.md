# Implementation Status

Current status of the export/import system implementation.

## Complete

### Core Infrastructure
- [x] PersistenceActor and ExportManager with proper isolation
- [x] Export directory structure with compression
- [x] Error handling and state management
- [x] JSON encoding with formatting and sorting

### Export Sequence
- [x] Stats collection and metadata.json creation
- [x] Places export with complete data
- [x] Items export preserving edge relationships
- [x] Samples export in UTC week-based files
- [x] Gzip compression integration

## In Progress
